# caching-proxy
A CLI tool that starts a caching proxy server, which forwards requests to the actual server and caches the responses. This project aims to reduce the load on the actual server by caching frequently requested resources, thereby improving the overall performance and responsiveness of the system.

**Directory Structure:**

The project is organized into the following directories and files:

* `src/`: This directory contains the source code for the project.
	+ `__init__.py`: An empty file that makes the `src` directory a Python package.
	+ `main.py`: The entry point of the application, responsible for starting the caching proxy server.
	+ `proxy/`: A subdirectory containing modules related to the proxy server.
		- `__init__.py`: An empty file that makes the `proxy` directory a Python package.
		- `server.py`: Implements the logic for starting and managing the proxy server.
		- `cache.py`: Handles caching of responses from the actual server.
		- `utils.py`: Provides utility functions for the proxy server.
	+ `config/`: A subdirectory containing configuration files.
		- `__init__.py`: An empty file that makes the `config` directory a Python package.
		- `settings.py`: Defines configuration settings for the caching proxy server.
* `tests/`: This directory contains test cases for the project.
	+ `__init__.py`: An empty file that makes the `tests` directory a Python package.
	+ `test_server.py`: Test cases for the proxy server module.
	+ `test_cache.py`: Test cases for the cache module.
	+ `test_utils.py`: Test cases for the utility functions.
* `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required to run the project.
* `setup.py`: A script for installing the project and its dependencies.
* `README.md`: This file, which provides an overview of the project and its structure.

**How it Works:**

1. The caching proxy server is started by running the `main.py` script.
2. The server listens for incoming requests and forwards them to the actual server.
3. The responses from the actual server are cached using the `cache.py` module.
4. Subsequent requests for the same resource are served directly from the cache, reducing the load on the actual server.
5. The `utils.py` module provides utility functions for tasks such as error handling and logging.

**Benefits:**

1. **Improved Performance**: By caching frequently requested resources, the caching proxy server reduces the load on the actual server, resulting in faster response times and improved overall performance.
2. **Reduced Server Load**: By serving cached responses, the caching proxy server reduces the number of requests sent to the actual server, thereby reducing the server load and improving its responsiveness.
3. **Enhanced Scalability**: The caching proxy server can be scaled independently of the actual server, allowing for more efficient use of resources and easier maintenance.

**Getting Started:**

To use the caching proxy server, follow these steps:

1. Install the project and its dependencies by running `python setup.py install`.
2. Configure the caching proxy server by modifying the settings in `config/settings.py`.
3. Start the caching proxy server by running `python src/main.py`.
4. Direct your requests to the caching proxy server instead of the actual server.
